========

**Git** = a tool for managing projects, originally software. You can use Git to track changes made to files in your projects.

**Github** = an set of interfaces (on the web and your computer) that facilitate project management via Git. You can access much of the power of Git via Github. 

You should be able to get the jist of Git by using Github. Explore the files in this repository and try changing files. Remember to "commit" (see below) your changes that you make!

*Terminology*
- Repository = a project and associated files from Git 
- Cloning = copying a repository from one computer (usually a server) to another
- Branching = telling Git to keep changes that you make separate from other changes made in a repository, which is useful for creating software versions 

*Advanced Concepts*
- Forking = cloning a repository without contributing changes back to the original repository, like sympatric evolution you get something new through isolation
- Adding = tells Git to track changes to files
- Committing = groups added changes together with annotation, which combined with adding allows the user to break up tasks
- Pushing = takes committed changes on one computer (i.e., yours) and combines them with changes on another computer (e.g., a server)
- Master = the primary branch of a repository, which you can think of as the "stabile" version of the package that everyone should be using
- Origin = the "other" computer the commits are pushed
