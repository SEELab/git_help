Generic Git Workflow
====================

1. I suggest working in Github first, but if you want to work on your computer you will need to initiate or clone a repository.
2. Checkout the proper branch relevant to your project (see [https://github.com/SEELab/git_help/blob/master/branching.md](branching) file in this repository)
3. Make changes to files.
4. Annotate and commit changes (Note: commendline users will need to add changes before committing and then pushing)
5. Repeat.
