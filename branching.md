Git Branches
============

Branching allows users to control how the changes that they make get combined.

A good framework for branching can be found here: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Here is a summary of this method:
- Master = the main branch that is the stabile version
- Develop = the development version of the package
- Features = branches checked out to add particular things to the package
- Hotfix = a branch to make a sudden change to the package in emergencies
