Generic Git Workflow
====================

0. I suggest working in Github first.
1. Initiate or clone a repository.
2. Checkout the proper branch relevant to your project (see branching file in this repository)
3. Make changes to files.
4. Annotate and commit changes (Note: commendline users will need to add changes before committing and then pushing)
5. Repeat.
